# ---------------------------
# Wildfire-Specific Treatment Code
# ---------------------------
# TO DO:
# 1. Develop a wildfire-specific code:
#    a. Remove wildfire boundaries from polygon processing.
#    b. Add a wildfire mask in all DART runs except for post-fire recovery treatments.
#    c. Ensure a second DART run for post-fire recovery polygons.
#
# Masks for DART runs:
# - MTBS Fire Boundary
# - InterAgency Fire Perimeter: https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::interagencyfireperimeterhistory-all-years-view/explore?location=13.716471%2C57.912975%2C2.68&showTable=true
# - Treatments within WRI and LTDL
# - Roads and parking lots (create a CONUS-wide mask)
#
# Additional TO DO:
# - Set a cutoff for environmental pixel matching between treatment and control (e.g., Gower's distance).
# - Aggregate treatment types.
# - Compile model options.

### The code in this file is cleaning up the polygons so that they are:
# Step 1: Filter Polygons within Utah State Boundary
# Step 2: Filter Applicable Restoration Treatments
# STEP 3: All Projects Occur Within a Single Year
# STEP 4: Initiation and completion occur within roughly 3 years
# STEP 5: Exclude Wetland and Riparian Areas
# STEP 6. have not experienced a wildfire **** THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED 
# STEP 7. are less than 1/2 km squared **** THIS REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED FOR NOW

### STEP 4: Initiation and completion occur within roughly 3 years ###

#### STEP 5: Exclude Wetland and Riparian Areas ####

#### STEP 7: Filter Polygons Smaller Than 0.5 kmÂ² ####

# Calculate area (in the same units as the projection, e.g., square meters for UTM)
# final_year_sf_filtered4$area <- st_area(final_year_sf_filtered4)
